It's a IOT based project to switch on and off our home appliancies and aslos we can monitor t-emperature and humidity of our home and also detects any type of gas leakage &amp; also detects motion.

Here this project is completely based on arduino board that is nodemcu ESP8266 wifi baord.

where, Home_Automation_Multi_Sensor.ino is a file where all the coding is written in arduinoIDE.
&
GAHA_Complete_doc.docx this document file contains documentation and configuration of project like,

1) Circuit diagram
2) Application configuration.
3) Configuring devices.
4) Detailed information of nodemcu Board.
5) Sensors used.
etc,

Platform used in this project is AdafruitIO, IFTTT & IOTMQTTPanel(application).

Also there is video of working of the project.
