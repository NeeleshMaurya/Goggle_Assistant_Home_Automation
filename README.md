# Goggle_Assistant_Home_Automation
It's a IOT based project to switch on and off our home appliancies using voice commands through google assistant or also using an application, we can monitor temperature and humidity of our home, the reading of that temperature & humidity in the appp,It also detects any type of gas leakage & also detects motion.

this required continues wifi through that we can controll and monitor devices from any where in the world.

Here this project is completely based on arduino board that is nodemcu ESP8266 wifi baord.

where, Home_Automation_Multi_Sensor.ino is a file where all the coding is written in arduinoIDE.
&
GAHA_Complete_doc.docx this document file contains documentation and configuration of project like,

1) Circuit diagram
2) Application configuration.
3) Configuring devices.
4) Detailed information of nodemcu Board.
5) Sensors used.
etc,

Platform used in this project is AdafruitIO, IFTTT & IOTMQTTPanel(application).

Also there is video of working of the project on this link given below
